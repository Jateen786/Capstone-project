# Capstone-project - - Controlling laptop with hand gesture
Description:
Welcome to Laptop Gesture Control! This project aims to provide an intuitive and futuristic method for interacting with your laptop using hand gestures. With the integration of computer vision techniques and machine learning algorithms, you can now navigate, control media, and execute commands on your laptop simply by moving your hands in front of its camera.

Features:

Gesture Recognition: Effortlessly control your laptop using predefined hand gestures.
Navigation: Navigate through applications, web pages, and menus with simple hand movements.
Media Control: Play, pause, adjust volume, and switch between media tracks without touching your keyboard or mouse.
Custom Commands: Define custom gestures to execute specific commands tailored to your workflow.
Easy Setup: Simple installation process and minimal hardware requirements make getting started a breeze.
How it Works:
Laptop Gesture Control leverages the power of computer vision algorithms to analyze the video feed from your laptop's camera in real-time. By detecting and tracking the movement of your hands, it recognizes predefined gestures mapped to various actions. These gestures are then translated into corresponding commands, allowing you to interact with your laptop in a natural and intuitive manner.

Getting Started:

Installation: Clone this repository to your local machine.
Dependencies: Ensure you have Python installed, along with the necessary libraries listed in the requirements file.
Setup: Follow the setup instructions provided in the README to configure your environment and install any additional components.
Calibration: Run the calibration script to calibrate the gesture recognition model according to your hand size and environment.
Launch: Execute the main script to start the gesture control interface.
Start Gesturing: Once the interface is running, begin making gestures in front of your laptop's camera to interact with it.
